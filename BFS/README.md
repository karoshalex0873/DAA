# Maze Game Solver

## Overview

This project provides a Python implementation of a maze solver using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It generates a random maze, solves it to find the shortest path from the start to the goal, and visualizes the maze along with an animation of the BFS exploration process.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Creates a random maze with walls and open spaces.
- **BFS Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
- **Visualization**: Displays the maze and animates the BFS exploration using Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run the maze game solver, ensure you have Python installed. You also need to install the required dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd maze-game-solver
